### The best way to give me feedback is
Ideally, face-to-face, so if you're comfortable with that we'll hop on a call. I'm happy for it to be in any format, so long as it's timely and specific

### The basics you should know about me areâ€¦
Primarily remote but will happily go to the office with enough notice. 

I have a record of being my own worst critic and can start to get a bit silent/resentful when things aren't always as I want them, don't take it personally! 

I don't like: 

- Working with a lack of direction/planning
- Mobbing for too long
- Working in isolation (for too long)
- Too many video calls, much prefer audio only
- People talking over each other

I do like:
- Being prepared for meetings/projects
- Mobbing where needed, but ideally pairing
- Space to work out problems, but don't leave me alone for too long or I will get distracted.
- Collaboration
- Workshops!

I often have my headphones on listening to whatever the Spotify Gods recommend, but _always_ feel free to interrupt me

### Beyond work, Iâ€™m really passionate aboutâ€¦
Happiest when outdoors - camping/hiking/cycling etc. 

I have two boys I co-parent roughly three nights a week, so there might be days when I have to drop off work a little earlier, but I'll always be free for async chats.

### My best working patterns look like thisâ€¦

- Early mornings: up until 11:30am 
- Late afternoons: from 14:30(ish) 

Worth noting I have the school run on Wednesday/Thursday mornings and Friday afternoons.

### When I'm dealing with stress, Iâ€¦
I get a bit sweary and can be a little abrupt.

### My absolute requirements to do great work areâ€¦

- Being valued
- Having opportunities for progression.
- Goals: Ideally small pieces of work that are 'to-do' list friendly
- Good coffee (non-negotiable)
- Good music
- A clear idea of "why are we doing this"
